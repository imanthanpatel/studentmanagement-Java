# 🎓 Student Management System

A **Student Management System** built using **Java 17** and **Spring Boot**, designed to manage students, courses, and related operations in a secure, structured, and scalable way.

This project is part of my hands-on learning to strengthen **backend development skills** and understand real-world application architecture using Spring technologies.
